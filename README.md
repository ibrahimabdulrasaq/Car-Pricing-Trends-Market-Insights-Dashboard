# Car Pricing Trends & Market Insights Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a price-focused analysis of the used car market using Power BI. The goal was to identify the key factors that drive vehicle prices and translate those findings into actionable business insights.

The analysis was intentionally designed around one clear objective rather than multiple disconnected questions, ensuring clarity, focus, and real-world relevance.

## 🎯 Business Objective

To analyze and identify the primary pricing drivers across:

* Transmission type
* Brand (Make)
* Model year

…and demonstrate how these factors can support pricing strategy, inventory decisions, and revenue optimization.

## 👤 Role Performed

**Sales / Pricing Analyst**
(With a strong Business Intelligence focus)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, and interactive dashboards
* Power Query – Data cleaning and preparation

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset represents a multi-brand used car market covering the period 2000–2020. Each record corresponds to an individual vehicle listing and includes pricing, technical specifications, and categorical attributes.

### Key Fields

* **Price** – Listed selling price of the vehicle (primary measure)
* **Year** – Vehicle production year
* **Make** – Manufacturer / brand name
* **Model** – Vehicle model
* **Transmission** – Manual, Automatic, Semi-Automatic
* **Fuel Type** – Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid
* **Mileage** – Distance covered by the vehicle
* **Engine Size** – Engine capacity

The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, ensure consistent data types, and standardize categorical fields before analysis.


## 📊 Dashboard Development & Features

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Automatic Transmission Consistently Commands a Price Premium

Automatic vehicles consistently record higher average prices than manual and semi-automatic vehicles.

**Insight:** Transmission type is a major price driver, with buyers willing to pay a premium for convenience.

### 2. Vehicle Prices Have Increased Over Time

The price trend shows a steady upward movement in recent years.

**Insight:** Model year strongly influences pricing, with newer vehicles maintaining higher resale value.

### 3. Premium Brands Maintain Higher Average Prices

Premium brands consistently record higher average prices compared to mass-market brands.

**Insight:** Brand reputation significantly impacts pricing beyond vehicle specifications.

### 4. Fuel Type Influences Pricing

Diesel and hybrid vehicles show higher average prices compared to petrol vehicles.

**Insight:** Fuel efficiency and long-term ownership considerations influence buyer willingness to pay.

### 5. Market Demand Favors Automatic Vehicles

Automatic vehicles dominate buyer preference across the dataset.

**Insight:** Customer demand aligns closely with higher pricing, reinforcing the value of automatic transmission vehicles.

## ✅ Recommendations

* Prioritize automatic transmission vehicles, especially newer models, to maximize revenue potential
* Apply brand-based pricing strategies:

  * Maintain premium pricing for high-value brands
  * Use competitive pricing for economy brands
* Optimize pricing by model year, using newer vehicles as revenue drivers and older vehicles as entry-level options
* Highlight fuel efficiency (diesel & hybrid) in vehicle listings to justify pricing
* Track median price alongside average to reduce distortion from high-priced outliers

## 🧠 Summary

This analysis demonstrates that transmission type, brand positioning, and vehicle age are the primary drivers of used car pricing. Applying these insights enables more informed pricing strategies, optimized inventory decisions, and improved revenue outcomes in the used car market.
